    <h2>Food & Drink</h2>
    <p2>Try traditional Scottish dishes like haggis or enjoy fresh seafood in Leith. Visit local pubs for whisky tasting and live music.</p2>

    <img src="haggis.jpg">
    <ul>
      <li> Haggis is Scotland’s most famous traditional dish. It’s a savoury pudding made from minced sheep’s heart, liver, and lungs mixed with onion, oats, suet, spices, and stock. The mixture is traditionally cooked in a sheep’s stomach, but most modern versions use a casing instead.
      It has a rich, peppery flavour and is usually served with mashed turnips and potatoes. You’ll find it in pubs, restaurants, and even in breakfast menus around Edinburgh and there are plenty of vegetarian haggis options too.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> <U>Stovies </U></h3>

    <UL>
      <li>Stovies are a traditional Scottish comfort food made by slowly cooking potatoes, onions, and leftover beef or lamb together in one pot. The result is a warm, hearty dish with soft, rich flavours perfect on a chilly Edinburgh evening.
     Every household and pub has its own twist, but stovies are always simple, filling, and authentically Scottish.</li>

    <h2> Traditional music of Edinburgh </h2>
    <audio controls  loops> 
      <source src="Flowers-Of-Edinburgh.mp3">  
    </audio>
    <ul> 
      <li><Strong> The Flowers Of Edinbrugh </Strong></li> 
      <li>Some believe the title may have been a playful or ironic reference to the smells of Edinburgh in the 1700s (when sanitation was poor), but this is debated. Others think it simply refers to the pride or “finest qualities” of the city.</li>
      <li><strong> Where you may hear it </strong></li>
      <li> Mostly in pubs during flok sessions or preformed by street buskers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Visitors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Best time to visit: May to September. This is because the weather is balanced and there are fewer crowds comared to other months</li>
      <li> August is also a fun time as its Festival month but hotels would be most exspensive and ztreets re packed. But if this is your idea of a holiday then go for it</li>
      <li> Winter time is magical if you enjoy Christmas markets and cozy nights, but expect early sunsets.</li>
    </ul>
